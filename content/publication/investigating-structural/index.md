abstract: "In this work, CdS, ZnS and ZnO thin films have been deposited by chemical bath deposition technique and dried at 150C for 30 min. Detail optical and structural characterizations have been done by UV-Vis spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction analysis to get a comparative study between 3 samples. The XRD analysis has revealed that CdS and ZnO have hexagonal wurtzite crystal structures while ZnS has Zinc blend crystal structure. Lattice parameter and crystallite size were also measured from XRD. From UV spectra it is seen that ZnS and ZnO have transmittance in the range of (85-90) % which was greater than that of CdS. Deposited CdS, ZnS and ZnO reportedly have band gaps of 2.0 eV, 3.63 eV and 3.65 eV respectively. It is proposed that among 3 samples ZnO has more suitable properties as the window layer for thin film solar cell."
