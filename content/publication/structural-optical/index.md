abstract: "Transparent and well adhered Sn doped ZnS films have been synthesized on glass substrates by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) process. An analysis derived from XRD pattern revealed the presence of cubic structure in the Sn:ZnS thin films, with an impurity phase corresponding to the insertion of Sn ions in interstitial sites or defects of the lattice. The atomic ratio of Sn in ZnS films have been confirmed by EDX spectra. Changes in the optical properties of the films have been observed due to incorporation of Sn by UV-Vis-Nir Spectrophotometer analysis."
