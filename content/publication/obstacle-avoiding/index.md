abstract: "A real-time obstacle avoidance ROBO-CAR has been designed using microcontroller. A dynamic algorithm is designed that directs the robot to navigate smoothly in any flat environments, avoiding obstacles. The obstacle detection scheme is based on an ultrasonic sensor. The microcontroller takes input from the sensor and then compares the input with predefined reference. Then it gives input to the two h-bridges that in turn direct the motors to control the movement of the robo-car. Here, the car moves continuously forward and avoid obstacles by stopping and steering away immediately."
